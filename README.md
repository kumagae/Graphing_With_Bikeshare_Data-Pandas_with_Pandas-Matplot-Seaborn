# Pandas-Wrangling-Matplot-SNS---Graphing_With_Bikeshare_Data
Pandas, Wrangling, Matplot, SNS project with SF bike sharing data set.

The jupyter notebook project read plaintext delimited ata into pandas, data wrangled and plotted to show how 
the day of month, how the day of the week, how the time of day, and how the weather affected bike rider numbers. 
It also takes a look at rider distribution through histograms, scatterplots, countorplots, and heatmapping.

This same analysis can be used with any dataset containing a usership and temporal relationship. Potential applications may include how 
time of day affects advertisment click rates, how time and weather affect usership and more.
